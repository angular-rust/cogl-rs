**cogl-sys-rs** is FFI bindings to Cogl library. cogl-sys-rs is being developed in the Angular Rust infrastructure since Angular Rust depends on it.

**COGL** is a modern 3D graphics API with associated utility APIs designed to expose the features of 3D graphics hardware using a more object oriented design than OpenGL. It is used primarily by Clutter to provide a common rendering API that works transparently across OpenGL >=1.4, OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0.
It is not tied to any one toolkit or even constrained to developing UI toolkits.

**Angular Rust** is a high productivity, `platform-agnostic` frontend framework for the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It now supports desktop and web development. Angular Rust currently uses GTK for desktop development and WebAssembly for web development. We are planning to add support for mobile development.

## Quick Start

Install Cogl-rs:

	cargo add cogl-rs
